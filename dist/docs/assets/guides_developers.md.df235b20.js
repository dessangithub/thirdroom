Using the Web Scene Graph API, anyone can create and share their own virtual worlds and experiences with the language of their choice. The Third Room client is also completely open source, allowing you to self-host your own instance of Third Room and customize it to meet your specific needs. The Third Room web client is also designed to be just one client in a larger ecosystem of interoperable clients for browsing virtual worlds created with glTF and WebSG content.</p><h2 id="web-scene-graph" tabindex="-1">Web Scene Graph <a class="header-anchor" href="#web-scene-graph" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Web Scene Graph&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WebSG is designed to provide a safe and performant way to manipulate glTF scene graphs from a WebAssembly module. The API can be accessed from any wasm-compatible language, giving you the flexibility to choose the programming language that best suits your needs and expertise.</p><p>There is also a custom JavaScript runtime and in-world editor, allowing you to fluidly write and edit scripts in a familiar and friendly language without leaving the Third Room client.</p><p>By utilizing the WebSG, you can create advanced and interactive experiences within Third Room that respond to user input, trigger events, and dynamically alter the virtual environment.</p><p><a href="./websg/">Read more about Web Scene Graph</a></p><h2 id="self-hosting" tabindex="-1">Self-Hosting <a class="header-anchor" href="#self-hosting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Self-Hosting&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Third Room can be self-hosted, giving you even more control over the user experience and content distribution. By self-hosting, you can customize the client to meet your specific needs and requirements while still benefiting from the core functionality of Third Room.</p><p>Third Room is a single page web app (SPA) and can be hosted on any static web server. You do not need to host your own Matrix homeserver in order to customize or self-host your own Third Room client.</p><p><a href="./self-hosting.html">Read more about self-hosting Third Room</a></p><p>If you also want to self-host a Matrix homeserver, please refer to the <a href="https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/develop/welcome_and_overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Synapse documentation</a>.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Third Room uses Matrix&#39;s Group VoIP Calls feature to enable networking and voice chat in virtual worlds. In order for WebRTC calls to connect in all networking scenarios, you should set up a TURN server such as Coturn.
