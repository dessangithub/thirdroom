From there, it’s an obvious extension to add more\n          sophisticated collaboration features such as the ability to send files, share locations, send voice messages,\n          embed widgets, etc. The next level up from that is to add voip calling, to upgrade rooms into voice and{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1566063359996428289\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\n          >\n            video rooms\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          for end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) conferencing.

The Web is finally at the point where it’s\n            possible to build a game engine whose performance rivals native applications - and so while many roads into\n            the metaverse seem to involve installing enormous proprietary Windows-only native apps via Steam, Third Room\n            is available to anyone with a web browser. We’ve tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari, but it should work on\n            any modern up-to-date browser… including on older machines: after all, the Web is for everyone. For\n            instance, Third Room runs fine on a 2010 Macbook Air with integrated graphics. Today’s release is desktop\n            web only, but mobile web is not far away (and performance is great!). Obviously there’s nothing stopping\n            people from also building Third Room compatible native clients too (same as for normal Matrix) - and we hope\n            to see Godot, Unity and Unreal clients emerge in due course!

Just like the Web, you shouldn’t have to pay to\n            participate, and it should be open to everyone, without walled gardens or silos, and you should certainly\n            not have to pay for it with your data or metadata. We want to provide a truly equitable environment where\n            everyone is equal to create their own content and participate without intrinsic privilege or inequality. As\n            a result, there is no artificial scarcity in Third Room, or virtual real-estate speculation, or intrinsic\n            currencies: just like Matrix, everyone is free to participate on a level pegging, and there are no financial\n            incentives baked into the system. Of course, folks are welcome to sell or trade content, avatars, assets,\n            apps - just like on the Web - and there’s nothing stopping you from using cryptocurrencies either. But the\n            platform itself will never have financial incentives or primitives baked in.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <span className=\"semi-bold\">Aesthetically beautiful.</span> We’re determined that Third Room’s engine should\n            be as visually sophisticated and aesthetically beautiful as possible, and that we should seed the ecosystem\n            with beautiful high-quality artwork and assets.
